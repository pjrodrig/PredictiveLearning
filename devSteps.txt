build basic neuron data structure
neuron
in - pipe - out

in - the input of the problem
{
   xPosition: 34,
   yPosition: 14,
   whatever: true,
   whatever2: 'asdf'
}

pipe
associations(shortcuts) between other neurons

out
the action taken


only give inputs with names
entry neurons should be created based on a hash generated by input



add different types of searches that run simultaneously
change search type by changing the set of items searching upon
can even change the weight of search item to weigh it in decision making more heavily


neuron tree will have maintenance methods
tags will be cleaned up
tag groups will be found by searching neurons holding tags

training sessions is the collection of neuron paths that will be effected by good/bad choices

more advanced learning includes imitation
