instincts are the key to evolving minds
brain network randomly chooses traits to associate with success
previously used trait groupings have a higher chance of being used
if the result is the same, then the weight of its evaluation is raised, otherwise the weight is lowered, or in some cases forgotten


neurons will remember the neurons they reach out to
if they reach out to another neuron, then weight + 1
the weight multiplier will have to be experimented with

a neuron's reach is determined by a weighted random
a neuron is most likely to reach to neurons that they've reached to before
they're also more likely to reach to a neuron that a child neuron has reached to before
this can continue to more children. The depth should be experimented with
