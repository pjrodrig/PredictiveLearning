instincts are the key to evolving minds
brain network randomly chooses traits to associate with success
previously used trait groupings have a higher chance of being used
if the result is the same, then the weight of its evaluation is raised, otherwise the weight is lowered, or in some cases forgotten


neurons will remember the neurons they reach out to
if they reach out to another neuron, then weight + 1
the weight multiplier will have to be experimented with

whats good or bad is determined by instincts

a neuron's reach is determined by a weighted random
a neuron is most likely to reach to a neuron that was reached to before, and eventually had a good outcome
a neuron is more likely to reach to neurons that they've reached to before
they're also more likely to reach to a neuron that a child neuron that has been reached to before by a child Neuron
this can continue to more children. The depth should be experimented with

rules for weight
reach with good outcome. the sooner the good outcome was realized, the better. better if

following rules decay over distance of a reach
good outcome of relevant frequently used reach realized quickly (more advanced)
good outcome of relevant frequently used reach realized later
good outcome of frequently used reach realized quickly
good outcome of frequently used reach realized later
good outcome of used reach realized quickly
good outcome of used reach realized later
good outcome of rarely used reach realized quickly
good outcome of rarely used reach realized later
relative frequently used reach
good outcome of frequently used reach
