a new neural network should be applied to grouping neurons together and determining relations
good or bad is just true or false the value of good or bad is based on the complexity of the problem
if a problem took 10 steps to solve, then the value of the last decision is 10.
the value of the decision is only important for predicting outcomes
each input will be weighed separately and as a group
if inputs tend to be in a group and separately listed on a neuron, then it will be grouped in a smaller group with the other input
